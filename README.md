# About the project

This is a simple JavaFX program built upon "Kubbur". What makes our project special is that we added a gambling mechanism to the game. The player bets 20 coins and can win back some amount of coins if they play properly, based on how lucky they are. The player can also lose coins if they are unlucky.
